          The seven day week has no basis in any astronomical phenomenon and for
          a while, different cultures had varying lengths of time that made up a
          week. The ancient egyptians had a ten day week while while the
          Etruscans followed an eight day work week that was initally adopted by
          the Romans. In 321 CE, Emperor [NAME] decreed that the Roman empire
          would be following the seven day week and slowly this standard was
          adopted around the world.

          the seven celestial bodies (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter
          and Saturn) and neighboring territories began to adopt the unit as
          well. In 321 CE, Emperor [NAME] decreed that the Roman empire would be
          following the seven day week, acclerating the adoption of the this
          standard around the world.

          Many countries with Catholic/Protestant origins begin their week on
          Sunday, influenced in part by the Sabath being on Sunday. Influenced
          by Islamic traditions, the first day of the week is Saturday in many
          Middle Eastern and North African countries while the majority of
          Europe begins their week on a Monday. The International Organization
          for Standardization (ISO) counts Monday as the first day of their week
          for recordkeeping.
